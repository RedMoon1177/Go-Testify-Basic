# Go-Testify-Basic

Testify is a popular testing library for Go that provides tools and utilities to make writing tests easier and more expressive. It is widely used in the Go community for unit testing and includes the following components:

Assertions: A comprehensive set of assertion methods to verify the behavior of your code. This helps to avoid writing boilerplate code to check the test results.
Mocks: Provides an easy way to create mock objects that can be used to simulate dependencies and external services.
Suites: Allows you to group related tests together, providing setup and teardown methods that run before and after the tests in the suite.
